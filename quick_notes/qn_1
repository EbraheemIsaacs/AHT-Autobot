Hello,

I'm sorry to hear that you're not satisfied with the service from Amazon Logistics.

[INSERT IF THE CUSTOMER SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THEY DON’T WANT Amazon Logistics TO BE USED FOR THEIR ORDERS IN THE FUTURE:
I'm afraid that we don't have the ability to assign certain carriers to a specific customer or address but we’ll continue working with all of our carriers to drive improvements for our customers.]

[INSERT IF CUSTOMER COMMENTS ON DISPUTED DELIVERY ATTEMPTS:
I understand that the carrier states [a delivery attempt was/multiple delivery attempts were] made, but that you have advised this isn’t the case. We conduct investigations with Amazon Logistics to eliminate these issues, and ensure that parcels are successfully delivered.]

[INSERT ONLY IF CUSTOMER COMMENTS ON HOW ANGRY/FRUSTRATED ETC. THEY ARE: We understand how frustrating this is for you, and the inconvenience this has caused.]

We continually monitor the service provided by our carriers and take complaints of this nature very seriously. We’ll replace any items lost or damaged during delivery at no extra charge and monitor our carriers very closely.

We realise this incident reflects negatively upon Amazon.co.uk and the feedback you've provided will be used in reviewing the service provided by Amazon Logistics.

Thanks for taking the time to contact us and to bring this to our attention.

I hope this helps.

Hello,

The customer informs that the driver has on several occasions delivered to the neighbors instead of the actual address. It clearly states that the number on the house is 11 and the customer has recently caught the driver delivering the latest order to number 10. The customer is usually at home and upon tracking the order, the customer states that the driver scans the orders as delivered to a 'Sheed' instead of 'Shed', which is also an incorrect delivery preference as the customer added their front porch as a safe-place.  

Please assign a literate and competent driver to the address in the future.
